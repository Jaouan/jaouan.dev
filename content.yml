        Exposing around twenty business backends through the Backend-For-Frontend (BFF) pattern, this architecture incorporates Circuit Breaker mechanisms for enhanced resilience 
        and fault tolerance, Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) for efficient data interaction and separation of concerns, and advanced backpressure management strategies.
        Utilizing GraphQL Federation technologies, it also facilitates seamless schema stitching and service discovery, enabling dynamic and scalable aggregation of services.
        Additionally, this setup leverages API Gateway patterns for unified access control and rate limiting, ensuring optimal performance and security across the ecosystem.

      description: >
        On the opportunity of a massive migration to GitLab-CI for about 150 projects,
        a versatile and agnostic CI/CD setup was deployed.
        This setup was designed to be adaptable in building applications across various technologies,
        including Java, JavaScript, and Nginx, and anything else.
        Additionally, it maintained independence from specific cloud providers through the adoption of a GitOps approach.
        The modern pattern used in this project facilitated integration of various third-party solutions,
        enabling the establishment of quality and security gates.

        A trading bot leveraging Binance's websocket for live data acquisition.
        The data undergoes real-time analysis and processing through a stream flow, encompassing change detection networks,
        forecasting, and signal analysis, to inform decision-making and order execution.
        Additionally, the bot manages a portfolio and dispatches alerts. (Note: I still don't own a lambo)
